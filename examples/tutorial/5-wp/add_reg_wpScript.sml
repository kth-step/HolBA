 * The loop variant can help us prove that the loop terminates. The

 * decreasing for every loop continuation, and reaches its bound
 * upon exit.
 *
 * Concretely, we will prove HTs similar to those with the loop
 * invariant, only that this time we want to show that a variant
 * is strictly decreasing, instead of that the invariant is kept.
 * The variant (here R2) must obey the following:
 * 
 * 1. Strictly decrease as the loop body is executed
 * 2. When its lowest value is reached (zero), the loop terminates
 *
 * Depending on the algebraic properties of a variant, we might
 * also require that the starting value is inside some valid range.
